            <p>Hi, my name is <span class="purp">Christopher Fortin</span>, young, inspiring, energetic, outgoing. Those are the words I used to describe myself. I am 18 years old. I am from Burlington Vermont, Home of the Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream and world famous Vermont Maple Syrup. I was born in between mountains and raised in a valley. I grew up around technology all my life; my family was always about “in with the new out with the old”. I believe the web industry is the same way; every single day new things become obsolete. I believe that the World Wide Web can become anything we want it to. I want to become the one that sculpts the web into the applications we use every day to make our lives easier. With this drive I joined a web development class in high school where I learned all about HTML and CSS. This led me to Full Sail University where I currently attend to become a better developer. <span class="purp">I am on the path to my goals and nothing will stop me from reaching them.</span></p>
