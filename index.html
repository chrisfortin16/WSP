    <p class="about_p">Hi, my name is <span class="purp">Christopher Fortin</span>. Young, inspiring, energetic, outgoing, those are the words I used to describe myself. I am 19 years old. <span class="purp">I am from Burlington Vermont</span>, Home of the Ben and Jerrys Ice Cream and world famous Vermont Maple Syrup.<br />
      <br />
      I was born in between mountains and raised in a valley. I grew up around technology all my life; my family was always about in with the new out with the old. I believe the web industry is the same way; every single day new things become obsolete. <span class="purp">I believe that the World Wide Web can become anything we want it to.</span> I want to become the one that sculpts the web into the applications we use every day to make our lives easier.<br />
      <br />
      With this drive I joined a web development class in high school where I learned all about HTML and CSS. This led me to Full Sail University where I currently attend to become a better developer. <span class="purp">I am on the path to my goals and nothing will stop me from reaching them.</span></p>

  <!-- Blog, Components -->
  
  <h3>Component 1. HEADER</h3>
  <img src="images/header.jpg" alt="image of a header.">
  <h4>Target Audience:</h4>
  <p>The target audience for this website would be adults around the age of 20-40 looking for a well-organized service to help them with their problem.</p>
  <h4>Client/User Needs:</h4>
  <p>The users may also want to call strait away so the phone number is located in the top right comer where the user would look right away. Or if the user needed to find the location, it is located right smack dab in the middle. You get quick information with no effort on the user.</p>
  <h4>Critique:</h4>
  <p>The red bar located on the top of the page is supposed to draw your attention to it. The white easy to read text has good contrast so you can read with little effort. The way this website puts all the information vital to a website right on top of the header works for this website and is a good design strategy for quick information.</p>
  
  <h3>Component 2. HEADER_1</h3>
  <img src="images/header_2.jpg" alt="image of a header.">
  <h4>Target Audience:</h4>
  <p>The target audience that is being targeted for this header section would be men and woman who are between the ages on 20-50 looking for someone to help them with flooring a house. Based on the fact there is a login button the users would be able to long in and have an account. This aims at younger audiences because the owner of the site wants people to interact on his website.</p>
  <h4>Client/User Needs:</h4>
  <p>The needs of the user for this website would be someone looking for a flooring service. The user would be looking for someone they can call to come out to their house and put flooring in a house or apartment. The fact that the header is clean and efficient gives the user quick information that doesn’t put any strain on the user.</p>
  <h4>Critique:</h4>
  <p>This website header is very efficient and organized. The bright red color draws your eye to the most important sections of this site. However the extremely small font size and gray color used for the login and check out buttons really doesn’t do anything to add to the design. These links would be hard to see and people may not realize these are links and never click on them. </p>
  
  <h3>Component 3. CTA</h3>
  <img src="images/CTA.jpg" alt="image of a CTA.">
  <h4>Target Audience:</h4>
  <p>The target audience for this CTA would have to be men and woman around the ages of 20-50 who have a porch or need a service where they need to get in contact with the owners of the website.</p>
  <h4>Client/User Needs:</h4>
  <p>The client who came to this website and saw this CTA would most likely click on this CTA if they needed to find the social media for the owners of the website. They also may need to click on the tabs to look at the other photos for further information.</p>
  <h4>Critique:</h4>
  <p>The dark background and shadowy feel you get from the photo is supposed to give off a clean simple quality deck that you can trust to be provided to you. I like the font of this mostly because it has sharp serifs at the end of the words. The arrow button is displaying how many pictures are in the rotation so you don’t get confused when the picture scrolls through the other pictures.</p>
  
  <h3>Component 4. CTA_1</h3>
  <img src="images/CTA_1.jpg" alt="image of a CTA.">
  <h4>Target Audience:</h4>
  <p>The target audience for this website would have to be females between the ages of 15-40 looking to get skin care products or some sort of product that would make you look younger or more beautiful. </p>
  <h4>Client/User Needs:</h4>
  <p>If a user came to this site and saw this CTA they would want to click on it only if they where interested in what was being portrayed. This means that the user would have to be connected to the product on an emotional level so they would want to learn more or shop now in this case. </p>
  <h4>Critique:</h4>
  <p>The green on green works really well for this website. Also, the white sidebar on the sides of the CTA is the background color of the main wrap around the page. This gives off good contrast and gives the impression of the CTA coming off the page making it more noticeable.</p>
